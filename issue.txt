framer motion use

user signin shows him lms,on lms he chose to start test then first he should be given with instructions
 and button to start test at same route
so even by case user redirect to /quiz route and sign-in so automatically test not starts

and give user option that can take different test like just math,eng,physics,uet,nust
so in short first he chooses which one--then instructions page--ten test starts

make sure that mcq store in local storage or use db
and test stops when user switch the tab,close the browser
and when next time it opens it start from same place

make sure that the user past result and progress save if use db

also make sure that the results shown must include score in each section,and overall score

user should be able to review his test,he taken to see which one are correct and during this give option to chat with
trained modal to see why is it wrong and how to think or solve it
