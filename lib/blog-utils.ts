      content: `Time management is often the deciding factor between success and failure in competitive entry tests. This article shares proven strategies to help you manage your time effectively during both preparation and the actual exam.

      The Preparation Phase
      
      Create a Realistic Study Schedule
      
      Begin by creating a study schedule that accounts for all subjects, with more time allocated to challenging topics. Be realistic about how many hours you can productively study each day. Include breaks, leisure activities, and buffer time for unexpected disruptions.
      
      The 80/20 Principle
      
      Apply the Pareto Principle to your studies - identify the 20% of concepts that will help you solve 80% of the questions. Focus on high-yield topics first, especially those that frequently appear in past papers.
      
      Batch Similar Tasks
      
      Group similar activities together to minimize context switching. For example, dedicate specific time blocks for solving numerical problems across subjects, rather than jumping between different types of tasks.
      
      The Pomodoro Technique
      
      Use the Pomodoro Technique - study intensely for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. After four such cycles, take a longer 15-30 minute break. This approach helps maintain focus and prevents burnout.
      
      Weekly Reviews and Adjustments
      
      At the end of each week, review your progress and adjust your schedule if necessary. Be honest about what's working and what isn't, and don't hesitate to modify your approach.
      
      The Examination Phase
      
      Preview the Entire Paper
      
      When you receive the question paper, spend the first 2-3 minutes scanning it completely. This gives you an overview of what to expect and helps you allocate time appropriately.
      
      The Three-Pass Approach
      
      Implement a three-pass strategy:
      First pass: Answer all questions you can solve immediately
      Second pass: Tackle questions that require some thinking but are within your capability
      Third pass: Attempt the most challenging questions
      
      Time Allocation Formula
      
      Use this simple formula to allocate time: Total time รท Total marks = Time per mark. For example, if you have 60 minutes for a 60-mark paper, you have approximately 1 minute per mark. Adjust based on question difficulty.
      
      The 30-Second Rule
      
      If you can't figure out how to approach a question within 30 seconds, mark it and move on. Return to it later if time permits. Avoid the common trap of spending too much time on difficult questions.
      
      Buffer Time Management
      
      Reserve the last 5-10 minutes for reviewing your answers and attempting skipped questions. This buffer time is crucial for maximizing your score.`,
